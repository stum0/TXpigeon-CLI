# TXpigeon-CLI (WORK IN PROGRESS)

bitcoin transaction broadcaster written in rust

## broadcasts a raw bitcoin transaction to the bitcoin network. 

Opens a connection to 10 bitcoin nodes, randomly selected from bitcoin dns seeds. 

Sends an inv message which includes the txid of the transaction we want to broadcast to a randomly connected peer.

Replies to the GetData message with a TX message that includes the imported raw bitcoin transaction 

To confirm that the transaction has propogated around the network we listen to the other connected peers for a inv message which contains the txid of the broadcasted transaction. 
 

A new node will be selected every 10 seconds if we do not recieve the inv message from any of the connected nodes.
